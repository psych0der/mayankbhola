		<div class="project-content hnew">
		This website , mayankbhola.in is my latest web programming project(self evident :p) built on open source technologies.
		I have tried to build it as 
		more of a portfolio website where i can display my projects and write about myself.Here , like always i have given
		major attention to look and feel for great experience.This website is built upon django for server side support , uses
		bootstrap along with jquery for frontend.Further pygments and markdown modules for python are used for content editing
		such as blog posts.It uses <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/">scrollorama</a> , <a href="http://www.greensock.com">greensock</a> , <a href="http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/">jquery knob</a> for home page UI and disqus powered comments for blog post.
		Further it uses require.js for lazy loading of website resources.
		I'll will push the code to github after removing site specific config files.
