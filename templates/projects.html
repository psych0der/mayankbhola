		major attention to look and feel for great experience.This website is built upon django for server side support , uses
		bootstrap along with jquery for frontend.Further pygments and markdown modules for python are used for content editing
		such as blog posts.It uses <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/">scrollorama</a> , <a href="http://www.greensock.com">greensock</a> , <a href="http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/">jquery knob</a> for home page UI and disqus powered comments for blog post.
		Further it uses require.js for lazy loading of website resources.
