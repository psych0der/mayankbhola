This website , mayankbhola.in is my latest web programming project(self evident :p) built on open source technologies.
		I have tried to build it as 
		more of a portfolio website where i can display my projects and write about myself.Here , like always i have given
		major attention to look and feel for great experience.This website is built upon django for server side support , uses
		bootstrap along with jquery for frontend.Further pygments and markdown modules for python are used for content editing
		such as blog posts.It uses scrollorama : http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/ , greensock : http://www.greensock.com, http://knob : anthonyterrien.com/knob/ for home page UI and disqus powered comments for blog post.
		Further it uses require.js for lazy loading of website resources.
